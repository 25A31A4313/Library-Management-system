LIBRARY MANAGEMENT 

 SYSTEM

 A C PROGRAMMING FILE-HANDLING BASED MINI PROJECT

1.INTRODUCTION

The Library Management System is a simple C-language based mini 

project designed to manage library records efficiently.

It helps in storing book information, member details, and 

issue/return transactions using file handling concepts.

This project is developed for academic learning purposes and 

demonstrates how structured programming concepts can be 

applied to real-world library systems.

2.OBJECTIVES

➢ To maintain library records digitally

➢ To store book and member details using structures and files

➢ To automate book issue and return process

➢ To reduce manual work and errors

➢ To provide quick search facilities

3.SYSTEM FEATURES 

3.1 Add Book details 

The librarian can add book details such as:

➢ Book ID

➢ Book Title

➢ Author Name

➢ Quantity

All book records are stored permanently using file handling.

3.2 Add Member details 

Member details like

➢ Member ID and 

➢ Member Name are stored securely in a file.

3.3 Issue and Return Books 

➢ Books can be issued to members and returned after use.

➢ The available quantity is updated automatically.

3.4 Search book records 

➢ Books can be searched using:

➢ Book ID

➢ Book Title

Matching book details are displayed clearly.

3.5 Display Library Records 

➢ The system displays all available books with complete details 

in formatted output.

4.TECHNOLOGY & CONCEPTS USED 

4.1 C Programming Concepts 

➢ Structures

➢ Arrays & Strings ‐ to store book names

➢ Loops – for repeated Menu handling 

➢ Conditional Statement – to check books 

➢ Functions – for modular design

4.2 File Handling 

File handling is used to store library data permanently.

➢ Files Used:

▪ books.txt – Stores book records

▪ members.txt – Stores member records

5.DATA STRUCTURE 

➢ Copy code 

C

struct Book {

 int id;

 char title[50];

 char author[50];

 int quantity;

};

6.WORKFLOW

➢ Enter book and member details

➢ Store data in files

➢ Issue or return books

➢ Search and display records

7.FILE HANLDING APPROACH 

➢ Records are written to files using write mode

➢ Data is retrieved using read mode

➢ Data remains stored even after program termination

8.SAMPLE OUTPUT (CONSOLE) 

Copy code

====================================

 LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

====================================

Book ID : 101

Title : C Programming

Author : Dennis Ritchie

Quantity : 5

9.ADVANTAGES 

➢ Time Saving

The system reduces the time required to maintain records manually.

➢ Easy Record Management

Book and member details can be stored, searched, and updated 

easily.

➢ Accuracy

Automated operations reduce human errors in record keeping.

➢ Quick Search Facility

Books can be searched quickly using Book ID or Book Title

10. LIMITATIONS 

➢ Console Based Interface

➢ Limited Security

➢ File Size Limitation

➢ Single User Access

11.FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS 

➢ Graphical User Interface (GUI)

The system can be enhanced with a GUI for better user interaction.

➢ Login and Security Features

User authentication can be added to improve data security.

➢ Database Integration

File handling can be replaced with a database for better 

performance.

➢ Online Access

The system can be upgraded to support network or web-based access.

12.APPLICATIONS 

➢ School Libraries

Used to maintain book and student records efficiently.

➢ College and University Libraries

Helps in managing large collections of books and issuing systems.

➢ Public Libraries

Used for maintaining member details and book availability.

➢ Digital Learning Classes 

Helps in tracking learning resources and reference materials.

➢ Private Institutions and Training Classes 

Used to manage study materials and library resources.

13.CONCLUSION 

The Library Management System is a simple yet effective C-based 

mini project.

It demonstrates the use of file handling and structured programming concepts.

This project reduces manual work, accuracy and is suitable for 

beginners.
